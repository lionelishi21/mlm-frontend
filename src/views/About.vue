				Majestic Cares International, LLC (formerly Unlimited Enterprises, LLC) was established since 2004.
			   </p>

			   	<p>
				Founded by entrepreneurs, Bob Donald of South Carolina, Jim Miller & Larron Campbell of California and Rosalinda Burton of Utah, Majestic Cares Community (MCC), was created as an Online Community (https://majesticares.com) where Affiliate/Members actively participate in Community Cash Bonuses (Profit Sharing) Initiatives.
				</p>

				<p>
				Inspired by Ordinary People Nationwide, the Majestic Cares Community, “MCC,” was created so that ALL Affiliate/Members can receive a substantial residual income for any worthwhile purpose.
				</p>

				<p>
				Bob Donald owns and operates the Majesticares website from the cash sales revenue received from the MCC Community, and has been in the Networking industry since 1974. He was an accredited, licensed life Insurance Agent for New York Life Insurance Company until 1983. Since then, he has owned and operated numerous MLM Companies from 1987-2009. In 2010, he left the MLM industry and has been involved in the Real Estate Investment industry ever since.
				</p>

				<p>
				Realizing how the Real Estate Market catered to the rich and wealthy, Bob wanted to create a way for the poor and under-privileged, so they could be able to afford private homes of their own! 
				Hence, the advent of MCC, the Majestic Cares Community, which officially launched in June 2019, in an effort to raise enough capital to build affordable homes for the poor within his community, and eventually, around the world!
				</p>
				<p>
				Bob met MCC Co-Founders, Jim Miller of California, who has been a sales marketer since 2008, and Larron Campbell of California, who has also had many years of marketing experience. He also met Co-Founder, Rosalinda Burton, the final contributor, who became MCC’S voice, and assisted with MCC’S website, and audio/video presentation. Collectively, Bob Donald, the MCC’S Co-Founders, and its Active Affiliate/Members, are dedicated to fulfilling MCC’S primary objectives.
				</p>

				<p>
				It is important to know that MCC is not a Network, Multi-Level-Marketing, or an Investment Program. MCC is an International Online Community, which consists of top online sales marketing leaders, who bring their marketing skills with the ultimate best in Online Business Opportunities through Affiliate Marketing.
